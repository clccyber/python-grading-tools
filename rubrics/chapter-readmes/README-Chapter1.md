# Chapter 1 Rubrics - Getting Started with Python

## Rubrics Included (5 exercises)

1. **ex01** - Personal Information Display (print statements)
2. **ex02** - Rectangle Area (code entry from book)
3. **ex03** - Triangle Area (0.5 × base × height)
4. **ex04** - Circle Area (3.14 × radius²)
5. **ex05** - Cuboid Volume (height × width × depth)

---

## Chapter 1 Overview

**Topics Covered:**
- Basic `print()` statements
- `input()` function
- Type conversion with `float()`
- Variables and assignment
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`)
- Basic program structure

**Skills Developed:**
- Writing first Python programs
- Getting user input
- Performing calculations
- Displaying formatted output
- Debugging syntax errors

---

## Automated Grading Status

**Chapter 1 exercises are NOT automated** because:
- Very simple programs (learning basics)
- Personal information (ex01) varies by student
- Focus is on learning Python syntax
- Manual grading allows instructor feedback on style

**All exercises use manual rubrics.**

## Common Chapter 1 Issues

### Syntax Errors
- Missing quotes around strings
- Missing parentheses in `print()` or `input()`
- Typos in function names

### Type Errors
- Forgetting `float()` conversion
- Trying to do math on strings

### Logic Errors
- Wrong operator (+ instead of *)
- Wrong formula
- Missing parts of calculation

### Output Formatting
- Missing units (square units, cubic units)
- No labels on output
- Wrong units (square vs cubic)

---

## Grading Guidelines

### Point Distribution Philosophy

**Chapter 1 focuses on:**
- Does it run? (20-30 points)
- Does it get input? (15-25 points per input)
- Does it calculate correctly? (30-40 points)
- Does it output properly? (10-20 points)

**Be generous in Chapter 1:**
- Students are learning basics
- Syntax errors are expected
- Focus on whether they understand concepts
- Award partial credit liberally

---

## Testing Tips

### Quick Tests

**For all exercises:**
1. Does the file exist with correct name?
2. Does it run without errors?
3. Does it produce output?
4. Is the output roughly correct?

**Detailed checks** (if needed):
- Test with multiple inputs
- Verify calculations manually
- Check output formatting

---

## Student Instructions

**For Chapter 1 exercises, students should:**

1. Write the program in the specified filename
2. Test it with multiple inputs
3. Make sure output is clearly labeled
4. Include units where specified

**No automated grading for Chapter 1** - submit for manual review.

## Coverage

**5 rubrics for 5 exercises (100%)**

All rubrics include:
- Point breakdown
- Implementation example
- Test cases
- Common mistakes
- Key concepts

## Notes for Instructors

### First Programs

Chapter 1 is students' introduction to Python:
- Be patient with syntax errors
- Explain error messages clearly
- Encourage experimentation
- Focus on building confidence

### Emphasis

**What matters:**
- Program runs
- Basic logic is sound
- Output is labeled

**What doesn't matter yet:**
- Perfect formatting
- Optimal solutions
- Advanced techniques

### Feedback

**Good feedback in Chapter 1:**
- "Program works! Good job on the formula."
- "Close! Remember to convert input to float."
- "Output is correct, but add units for clarity."

**Avoid:**
- Overwhelming with advanced concepts
- Being too picky about style
- Expecting professional-level code

## Quick Reference

| Exercise | File | Concept | Points Focus |
|----------|------|---------|--------------|
| ex01 | myinfo.py | print() | Output correct (70) |
| ex02 | rectangle.py | input/calc | Book code accurate (60) |
| ex03 | triangle.py | formula | Correct calculation (40) |
| ex04 | circle.py | exponent | Using ** operator (55) |
| ex05 | cuboid.py | 3 inputs | All dimensions (45) |

---

## Getting Started

**For grading:**
1. Have student run program
2. Check output against rubric
3. Award points per category
4. Provide constructive feedback

**For students:**
1. Follow instructions exactly
2. Test with given examples
3. Make sure output matches format
4. Ask questions early!
