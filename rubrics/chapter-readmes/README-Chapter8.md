- ex07 - Invert (function mode with image validation) ✓

**8 exercises manual grading:**
- ex01-ex04 - Turtle graphics (visual verification)
- ex05, ex08-ex10 - PIL (function testing possible, visual check recommended)

## Teaching Notes

**Turtle Graphics Pedagogy:**
"Turtle graphics teach vector graphics and SVG concepts vs raster images"

Students can skip turtle exercises if they prefer (shhh 🤫)

**PIL Processing:**
Core concepts: pixel manipulation, RGB model, nested loops, bounds checking
